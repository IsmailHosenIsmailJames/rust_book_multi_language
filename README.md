# rust_book
### What was the idea ?
4 months ago, I did decide to learn Rust Programming Language. Because Rust have some awesome features and advantages. I found lots of resources. For beginners Rust Book is awesome. So I start study on about Rust with Rust Book. I then found some problem. Sometimes I don't carry laptop with me . At that time I can't explore Rust Book in offline. So, I decide to make a offline version of Rust Book for Android devices. I developed my android app and in the beginning it had only English version of Rust Book. Later my app user audience increase and some of them were requesting to make it available in multiple languages. Then I worked on this app for multiple languages. I collect 16 GitHub project where Rust Book was translated in different languages.  I collect 16 language those have good and stable translation. And now, My Rust Book have 16 different languages support for Rust Book. User can choice any language and then it will make download of that version of book and save it on local storage for offline use. Also my app have some addition features. For example, search, homepage, favorite, and change language any time etc. here all languages those my app support: 
1. Danske
2. Deutsch
3. English
4. Español
5. Esperanto
6. Farsi
7. Français
8. Polski
9. Português
10. Svenska
11. Русский
12. Українська
13. 正體中文
14. 简体中文
15. 한국어
16. 日本語
